# require-env

A simple library that forces the specific environment variable to be present in order to continue execution.
If the environment variable is not set, it will throw an error. It is then up to you to capture it or not.

# Planning

[ ] Make the library load automatically `.env` and other files to not depend on any other library related to environment variables.
